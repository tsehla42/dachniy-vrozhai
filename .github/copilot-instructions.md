## Instructions for Copilot:

Always refer to file llm-context.md for context about current project.

If you need additional context about some file, look at the .output/ folder
You can find all HTML there.

When explaining changes DO NOT create any .md files, write explanations in chat window.

Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without being explicitly asked to do that.

Always use nuxt-mcp for Nuxt related stuff.

Mention in your answers which MCP tools you used to get information.
